   <b>Docker</b> is an open-source software designed to facilitate and simplify application development. It is a set of platform-as-a-service products that create isolated virtualized environments for building, deploying, and testing applications.

   <b>A Docker image</b> is an immutable (unchangeable) file that contains the source code, libraries, dependencies, tools, and other files needed for an application to run
   
   <b>A Docker container</b> is a virtualized run-time environment where users can isolate applications from the underlying system. These containers are compact, portable units in which you can start up an application quickly and easily.
